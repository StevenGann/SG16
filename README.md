# SG16

For a couple years, I've kicked around the idea of building a CPU from scratch out of discrete logic gates. I never got far because without an FPGA it just isn't a practical goal.

Instead, I'm working on building an emulator instead, while designing the CPU architecture from the Assembly language level down and then up.
